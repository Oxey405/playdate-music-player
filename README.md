# MusicPlayer : Oxey405's MP3 Player for Playdate
This is a small MP3 player for the Playdate.

## Features
- Automatic Metadata extraction (ID3v1, ID3v2 support coming soon hopefully)
- Read MP3 files and folders recursively
- Make a Playlist (press `right` on selected track to add to playlist)
- Fast-forward the tracks or slow them down

## How to use
Put your Playdate in `Disk Mode` then go to `/Data/com.oxey405.musicplayer/Music` and drop your MP3 files and album folders there.

> Note : the BundleID (`com.oxey405.musicplayer` could vary a bit depending on how you sideloaded the app)

Eject the `PLAYDATE` then start the `Music Player` app

Select a track and play with `A` or add to playlist with `Right`

Enjoy your music !
